# The one wiki to rule them all
This place contains most popular data structures and algorithms with explanations and code samples (currently in Python)\
Sorted into two folders:
- [Data Structures](./datastructs/summary.md)
- [Algorithms](./algorithms/summary.md)

### Data structures and algorithms
A simple repo for learning about most popular and widely used ... in programming  
Idea is to make it also easily searchable  
Includes samples from Python, maybe other langs in future

Comparison with other structures for a specific type of data ie what kind of structure would be best for storing and working with this type of data

This book aims to assist in finding answers for following questions:
* What data structure I should use to store this type of data?
* What data structure I should use to work with this type of data?
* What algorithm to use for this type of problem?
* What algorithm would have the best time-space complexity for this type of problem?
* What structures and algorithms to use for networking for example?
* In what way does one data structure and/or algorithm differ from another, advantages/disadvantages?
* Speed of alorithms?

### Time complexity
> as the input size grows, how much longer does the algorithm take to complete?
### Space complexity
> as the input size grows, how much more memory does the algorithm use?
