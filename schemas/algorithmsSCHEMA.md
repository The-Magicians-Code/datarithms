# Name
This section must only contain two navigation paths:
Back - to return to the summary.md file
Home - to return to the index.md file
Make sure that the relative paths are valid, depending on where the algorithm file is located

navigation to the summary file and home should be as follows:
[Back](../summary.md)
[Home](../../index.md)
