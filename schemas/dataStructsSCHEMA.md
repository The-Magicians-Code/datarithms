# Name

This section must only contain two navigation paths:
- Back - to return to the summary.md file
- Home - to return to the index.md file

Make sure that the relative paths are valid, depending on where the data structure file is located.

**Example for files directly in datastructs/:**
```
[Back](./summary.md)
[Home](../index.md)
```

**Example for files inside a subfolder within datastructs/:**
```
[Back](../summary.md)
[Home](../../index.md)
```
