# The One Wiki to Rule Them All

A beginner-friendly guide to **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** with clear explanations and Python code examples.

## Start Here

- [Big O Notation](./bigO.md) - Understanding algorithm speed and efficiency
- [Data Structures](./datastructs/summary.md) - How to store and organize data
- [Algorithms](./algorithms/summary.md) - How to solve problems efficiently

## What You'll Learn

This guide helps answer common questions:

- **Which data structure should I use?** - Arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and when to pick each one
- **Which algorithm solves my problem?** - Sorting, searching, pathfinding, and more
- **How fast is it?** - Time and space complexity explained simply
- **What are the trade-offs?** - Pros and cons of different approaches

## Key Concepts

### Time Complexity
> How much *longer* does an algorithm take as input grows?

Example: Searching a phone book
- **O(n)** - Check every page (slow)
- **O(log n)** - Open to middle, eliminate half each time (fast)

### Space Complexity
> How much *more memory* does an algorithm need as input grows?

Example: Copying vs. sorting in-place
- **O(n)** - Need a full copy of the data
- **O(1)** - Only need a few extra variables

## Structure

Each topic includes:
1. **Definition** - What it is in plain terms
2. **Use cases** - When to use it
3. **Code** - Working Python examples
4. **Complexity** - Time and space analysis
5. **Trade-offs** - When to use vs. avoid
